# Future Enhancements

## Version 1.0
- Modular system of reductions [@reductions:2018]
  * New standard forms and solvers
  * Advanced user inputs, e.g. complex variables
- Disciplined geometric programming [@DGP]
- Variable and parameter attributes
- Transformations: linearize, indicator, partial optimization

## Internal Changes
- Uniform interface for solver settings
- Speed improvements by moving operations to C++
- Possibly connect to `ROI` library
