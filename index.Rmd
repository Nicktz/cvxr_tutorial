# Introduction

Optimization problems are at the heart of statistical inference and
machine learning, where a scalar
criterion is either maximized (likelihood, for instance) or minimized
(loss) to estimate a parameter of interest. Constraints might be
added to narrow the search space or to ensure the solution has certain
properties. 

The kinds of optimization problems we address in this tutorial have
the following form:
\[
\begin{array}{lll} \text{minimize} & f_0(x) & \\
  \text{subject to} & f_i(x) \leq 0, & i=1, \ldots, M\\
             & Ax=b &
\end{array}
\]
with variable $x \in {\mathbf R}^n$. 
  
Further, we ask that

- the objective and inequality constraints $f_0, \ldots, f_M$ are
  convex: for all $x$, $y$, $\theta \in [0,1]$,
\[
\begin{equation}
  f_i(\theta x + (1-\theta) y) \leq \theta f_i(x) + (1-\theta) f_i(y)
  (\#eq:convex-function)
\end{equation}
\]
i.e., graphs of $f_i$ curve upward,

- the equality constraints are linear, i.e., they can be expressed as a
  simple matrix equation $Ax = b$.

Geometrically, a function is convex if the chord or line segment drawn
from any point $(x, f(x))$ to another point $(y, f(y))$ lies above the
graph of $f$, as shown below.

```

A function is concave if $-f$ is convex. Every linear function is both
convex and concave.

Convex optimization problems have many nice properties:

- The region containing solutions, if any, is convex as it is the
  intersection of convex constraint functions.

- Since the objective is also convex, if we find a local optimal
  solution, it is automatically the global optimal solution.



There are a host of applications of this problem in many fields,
including machine learning and statistics.

## Convex Problems in Statistics, Machine Learning
 
- Maximum likelihood estimation with constraints
- OLS regression, nonnegative least squares, logistic regression
- Ridge, lasso, elastic-net regression
- Isotonic regression
- Huber (robust) regression
- Support vector machine
- Sparse inverse covariance estimation
- Maximum entropy and related problems

New methods are being invented every year!

## Non-convex Problems

A non-convex optimization problem is any problem where the objective
or any of the constraints are non-convex. Not every problem is convex,
and in fact, the non-convex set is much larger. Non-convex problems are
harder to solve in general.

However, even when a problem is non-convex, one may be able to find a
convex _relaxation_, an approximation to the original problem, that
can yield useful results. Thus, developing tools to solve convex problems
can go a long way.
