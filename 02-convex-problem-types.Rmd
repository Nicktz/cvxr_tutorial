# Types of Convex Optimization Problems

Recall that a convex optimization problem is of the form
\[
\begin{array}{lll} \text{minimize} & f_0(x) & \\
  \text{subject to} & f_i(x) \leq 0, & i=1, \ldots, M \\
             & Ax=b &
	     (\#eq:cvx-problem)
\end{array}
\]
for $x \in {\mathbf R}^n$. 


## Linear Programs

When the functions $f_i$ for all $i$ are linear in $x$, the
problem is called a linear program.  These are much easier to solve,
and the celebrated work of [George
Dantzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig) resulted in the
[_Simplex Algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm)
for linear programs. 

## Quadratic Programs

When the objective $f_0$ is quadratic in $x$, the problem is called a
quadratic program.

## Cone Programs

Second order cone programs

## Integer and Mixed Integer Programs

When all of $x$ is constrained to be integers, or even binary ($\{0,1\}$) values, the problem is called an integer program. If only a few $x$ are constrained to be integers, then the problem is a mixed integer program.
